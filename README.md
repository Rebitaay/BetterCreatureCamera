## Better Creature Camera

A set of tweaks for the Creature Stage camera that reduce annoying camera movements and enable better control over your perspective.

**Full Features:**

- Disabled camera auto-pitch when using WASD, click-to-move, and hold-to-move.
- Disabled camera auto-center when using click-to-move.
- Increased camera pitch limits to allow looking straight up and straight down.
- Increased vertical sensitivity modifier from 0.4 to 0.7 to match horizontal sensitivity modifier.
- Increased maximum camera distance from 25 to 2000. It's beautiful up there.
- Decreased minimum camera distance from 5 to 2.

**Known Issue:**
- Zooming out far enough despawns other creatures. The game's simulation is limited in distance and is tied to the camera's position rather than your avatar's position.
